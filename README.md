# Sales-Insight
Sales data analytics project highlighting exploratory analysis, SQL querying, and business insights via Tableau


Sales Insights Dashboard

This project is a data analytics pipeline built to showcase retail sales insights using Python (Pandas, NumPy) for preprocessing, SQL for querying, and Tableau for visualization. It demonstrates how raw transactional data can be transformed into actionable insights through analysis and interactive dashboards.

Features

Synthetic dataset generation (15,000+ sales transactions)
Data preprocessing & feature engineering with Pandas/NumPy
Exploratory Data Analysis: KPIs, trends, top customers & products
SQL scripts for querying retail metrics
Tableau dashboard for interactive visualization
Modular structure (separate notebooks, SQL scripts, and dataset exports)

Tech Stack
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
Database/Queries: SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite)
Visualization: Tableau
Tools: Jupyter Notebook

How It Works

1)Dataset Creation & Preprocessing
     Generates a synthetic retail dataset with sales, customers, and products.
     Cleans data and creates derived columns (Revenue, YearMonth, etc.).

2)Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
    KPIs: Total revenue, orders, customers, average order value
    Category-wise & region-wise performance analysis
    Monthly revenue trends and product-level insights

3)SQL Queries
   Top products and customers by revenue
   Monthly growth and segmentation queries
   Regional sales analysis

4)Tableau Dashboard
   Monthly revenue trend (line chart)
   Revenue by category (bar chart)
   Regional performance (highlight table)
   Top 10 products (bar chart)
